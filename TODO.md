# TODO: Make Travel Website Responsive

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Analyze current CSS for non-responsive elements (hero, map, destinations, hotels)
- [x] Add media queries for mobile (< 768px), tablet (768px-1024px), desktop (>1024px)
- [x] Update hero section: Reduce font sizes, adjust padding/margins for small screens
- [x] Update map section: Stack card and map vertically on mobile, center elements, make widths flexible
- [x] Update destination section: Make card group wrap, adjust card min-widths and gaps for different screens
- [x] Update hotel section: Ensure cards stack properly on mobile, adjust widths and heights
- [x] Update navbar and general styles: Adjust search box width, user section, etc.
- [x] Test responsiveness by running the site and checking on different screen sizes (attempted, but npm start failed due to PowerShell policy; browser tool disabled)
- [x] Final review and cleanup of CSS
